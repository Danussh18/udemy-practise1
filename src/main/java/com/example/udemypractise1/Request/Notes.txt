Swagger:
     1. Used for Documenting the API's so that Consumer will get to know the parameters,
        end point of API, type of HTTP Request, what's the use of calling. Everything will
        be documented in Swagger API.

     2. Swagger is a tool which automatically creates documentation for the API's so less
        manual efforts for API Documentation.

     3. Swagger provides UI, to consume the API's not just Documentation

LOGGER:

    1.To Debug and Troubleshoot the issue

    2. Different LEVELS for Logging

        Error < Warn < Info < Debug < Trace.
        Debug Level is Widely used.

        By default in spring-boot Info Level is Enabled.
            so Error, Warn, Info are Enabled by Default.

    3. We can have Different logging level for different packages and classes.

    4. Logs can be stored ( used dor debugging or analyzing )

        Example : 2021-06-12 14:16:43.516 ERROR 14528 --- [nio-3030-exec-7] c.e.u.Controller.StudentController       : Inside Error
            1. 2021-06-12 14:16:43.516                      - Time Stamp
            2. ERROR 14528 --- [nio-3030-exec-7]            - Logging type
            3. c.e.u.Controller.StudentController           - Class Name where actually logged
            4. Inside Error                                 - Message

    5. logging.level.root = debug
           for complete Spring boot Application logging level as debug
        logging.level.<package name> = trace/debug...
            for a specific package.

ASPECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING(AOP)

    1. Separating the logic and provides modularity
    2. Point Cut - Which method to Intercept?
    3. Advice - a) Before             - Before Returning to the value
                b) After              - After Returning but value not returned, execution completed
                c) AfterReturning
                d) Around             - before + after
    4. Aspect - Combination of Point Cut and Advice.
    5. Join Point - Execution Instance Of An Advice.
