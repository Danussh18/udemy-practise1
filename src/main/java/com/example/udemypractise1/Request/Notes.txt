Swagger:
     1. Used for Documenting the API's so that Consumer will get to know the parameters,
        end point of API, type of HTTP Request, what's the use of calling. Everything will
        be documented in Swagger API.

     2. Swagger is a tool which automatically creates documentation for the API's so less
        manual efforts for API Documentation.

     3. Swagger provides UI, to consume the API's not just Documentation
